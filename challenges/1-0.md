- Deploy a Bedrock single key-vault cluster
- Deploy the Azure voting app

- [Azure Single Keyvault: A Bedrock cluster environment](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/tree/master/cluster/environments/azure-single-keyvault)

Relevant commands:
- `spk infra scaffold`
- `spk infra generate`
- `terraform init`
- `terraform apply`

## Steps
Setting up GitOps on a Kubernetes cluster for the Azure voting app consists of:
1. [Get required resources](#get-required-resources)
2. [Add Deploy Key to manifest repo](#add-deploy-key-to-manifest-repo)
3. [Deploy Common Infrastructure](#deploy-common-infrastructure)
4. [Deploy an AKS cluster](#deploy-an-aks-cluster)
5. [Deploy the application](#deploy-the-application)

### Get required resources
To deploy a single key-vault cluster using `spk` you will need:
1. Service principal
2. Storage account
3. Storage account access key
4. Two resource groups (one for common infra and one for the cluster)
5. Deploy Key (for the manifest repo)
6. Node Key (for the cluster)

The [scripts/infra-setup.sh](../scripts/infra-setup.sh) creates this for you.

To run:
```
$ cd scripts
$ bash infra-setup.sh
```

This creates two files that contain the information of the required resources:
- **service-principal.json**
- **infra-values.txt**

### Add Deploy Key to manifest repo
The deploy key generated in [Required resources](#get-required-resources) needs to be added to the manifest repo voting-manifest (created in [Challenge 0](0.md)).

Get the deploy public key file from the infra-values.txt file. It will look something like this: /me/deployment/keys/gitops-ssh-key.pub

Get the value of the key:
```
$ cat /me/deployment/keys/gitops-ssh-key.pub
```

Copy the key value and add it to Azure DevOps, follow [these steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=current-page#step-2--add-the-public-key-to-azure-devops-servicestfs).

### Deploy Common Infrastructure
First we will scaffold the [azure-common-infra](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/tree/master/cluster/environments/azure-common-infra) environment. This is a prerequisite for deploying an [azure-single-keyvault](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/tree/master/cluster/environments/azure-single-keyvault) cluster (which we'll do later).

The azure-common-infra environment is a production ready template to setup these common elements of your infrastructure:
- vnets
- keyvault

1. Scaffold the components:
```
$ mkdir ~/cluster-deployment
$ cd ~/cluster-deployment
$ spk infra scaffold --name common --source https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock --version master --template cluster/environments/azure-common-infra
```

This fetches the specified deployment template, creates a cluster directory, and a definition.yaml. This is the infrastructure definition.

2. Fill out the definition.yaml:
```
name: common
source: 'https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock'
template: cluster/environments/azure-common-infra
version: master
backend:
  storage_account_name: <storage account name> (from infra-values.txt)
  access_key: <storage access key> (from infra-values.txt)
  container_name: <storage account container> (from infra-values.txt)
  key: tfstate-common-infra
variables:
  address_space: "10.39.0.0/16"
  keyvault_name: "<insert value>" (from infra-values.txt)
  global_resource_group_name: "<insert value>" (from infra-values.txt)
  service_principal_id: <insert value> (use the appId value from service-principal.json)
  subnet_name: <insert value> (from infra-values.txt)
  subnet_prefix: "10.39.0.0/24"
  vnet_name: "<insert value>" (from infra-values.txt)
```

#### Setup environment variables
```
$ export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="(from infra-values.txt)"
$ export ARM_TENANT_ID="(tenant from service-principal.json)"
$ export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="(password from service-principal.json)"
$ export ARM_CLIENT_ID="(appId from service-principal.json)"
```

#### Deploy common infra
```
$ cd ~/cluster-deployment/common
$ spk infra generate
```

This will generate the necessary files to deploy the infrastructure. The files should be available at `~/cluster-deployment/common-generated`.

1. Run terraform init:
```
$ cd ~/cluster-deployment/common-generated
$ terraform init -backend-config=./backend.tfvars
```

2. Verify with terraform plan:
```
$ terraform plan -var-file=spk.tfvars
```

3. Create the infrastructure components:
```
$ terraform apply -var-file=spk.tfvars
```

### Deploy an AKS cluster
After the azure common infrastructure is deployed, we will deploy an [azure-single-keyvault](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/tree/master/cluster/environments/azure-single-keyvault) cluster.

1. First we will scaffold the azure-single-keyvault environment.
```
$ cd ~/cluster-deployment
$ spk infra scaffold --name kv-cluster --source https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock --version master --template kv-cluster/environments/azure-single-keyvault
```

2. Fill out the kv-cluster/definition.yaml:
```
name: kv-cluster
source: 'https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock'
template: cluster/environments/azure-single-keyvault
version: master
backend:
  storage_account_name: (from infra-values.txt)
  access_key: (from infra-values.txt)
  container_name: (from infra-values.txt)
  key: tfstate-key
variables:
  acr_enabled: 'true'
  address_space: "10.39.0.0/16"
  agent_vm_count: "3"
  agent_vm_size: "Standard_D4s_v3"
  cluster_name: <insert value> (from infra-values.txt)
  dns_prefix: <insert value> (from infra-values.txt)
  flux_recreate: <insert value> (Remove this entry)
  gc_enabled: 'true'
  gitops_poll_interval: 1m
  gitops_label: flux-sync
  gitops_ssh_url: (The git url for your voting-manifest repository Eg.git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/me/my-project/voting-manifest)
  gitops_url_branch: master
  gitops_ssh_key: <insert value> (from infra-values.txt)
  gitops_path: ""
  keyvault_name: <insert value> (Use the value from common/definition.yaml)
  keyvault_resource_group: <insert value> (from infra-values.txt)
  kubernetes_version: 1.15.7
  resource_group_name: <insert value> (from infra-values.txt)
  ssh_public_key: <insert value> (Get the value for deployment/keys/node-ssh-key.pub, see the instructions below under "Get node key value")
  service_principal_id: <insert value> (Use appId value from service-principal.json)
  service_principal_secret: <insert value> (Use password value from service-principal.json)
  subnet_prefixes: "10.39.0.0/24"
  vnet_name: <insert value> (Use the value from common/definition.yaml)
  subnet_name: <insert value> (Use the value from common/definition.yaml)
  network_plugin: azure
  network_policy: azure
  oms_agent_enabled: 'false'
  enable_acr: 'false'
  acr_name: <insert value> (Remove this entry)
```
Generate the template:
```
$ cd ~/cluster-deployment/kv-cluster
$ spk infra generate
```

3. After the templates have been generated, do `terraform init`:
```
$ cd ~/cluster-deployment/kv-cluster-generated
$ terraform init -backend-config=./backend.tfvars
```

4. Check everything is ready to be created by running terraform plan:
```
$ terraform plan -var-file=spk.tfvars
```

5. If things look good, proceed to create the cluster:
```
$ terraform apply -var-file=spk.tfvars
```

### Deploy the application
Add the [azure-vote.yaml](../azure-vote.yaml) resource manifest for the voting application to the voting-manifest repository (created in [Challenge 0](0.md)).

Configure `kubectl` to connect to your cluster.
For `--resource-group` use the value `resource_group_name` from infra-values.txt. For `--name` use the value `cluster_name` from infra-values.txt
```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

Wait until the app has been deployed and the service is running. To monitor that, you'll find these commands useful:
- `kubectl describe`
- `kubectl get services`

Once the application is deployed you can go to the external IP to view it.

## SSH key values
### Get node key value
In the [Required resources](#get-required-resources) step, we created the node key. Check the location of the file in infra-values.txt. It should look similar to this: /me/cluster-deployment/keys/node-ssh-key.pub

Get the value of the key:
```
$ cat /me/deployment/keys/node-ssh-key.pub
```
Copy this value into `ssh_public_key` in kv-cluster/definition.yaml
